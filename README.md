# sanegl
*bring some basic sanity into your GL code*

* limit boilerplate
* hide global state (at least until I switch to OpenGL 4.5 and start using DSA)
* BETTER FREAKING DOCUMENTATION

## docs
I'm experimenting with literate programming for this project, so run `make docs` to generate the docs directory. I'm using pycco for now, but docco and its varients should work as well.

## demo code
`make demo && ./t/demo`

See `t/demo.c` for example codes and stuff.

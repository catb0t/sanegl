I'm using pycco for now, but docco and its varients should work as well.\r\n\r\n## demo code\r\n`make demo && ./t/demo`\r\n\r\nSee `t/demo.c` for example codes and stuff.\r\n\r\n## what's here\r\n* simple opengl helper library\r\n* `.3ds` file loader\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n* drop GLFW (only create a GL conetxt)\r\n* other file formats\r\n    * [MD2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD2_(file_format))\r\n    * [MD3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD3_(file_format))\r\n    * [MD5](http://www.3dgep.com/loading-and-animating-md5-models-with-opengl/)\r\n    * [OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file)\r\n    * [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format))\r\n    * MS3D\r\n* Port OpenGL to 4.5 (yay for DSA!)\r\n* Add Windows support (add `#ifdefs` and make the `makefile` more Windows friendly)\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n__What's the purpose of this project?__ <br/>\r\nIt's not a full graphics engine, it just limits the boilerplate for the majority of 3D rendering code you may have to write. Stuff like creating VAOs, VBOs, binding textures, initializing things and cleanup are all taken care of for you.\r\n\r\n__Why is this project written in C?__<br/>\r\nI don't like C++\r\n\r\n__Why do you have your own `3ds` parser built in (with more custom parsers to come)?__<br/>\r\nBecause Assimp is bloated and written in C++\r\n\r\n__Ewww you use snake_case?__<br/>\r\nEww to CamelCase. It's C. C code should always use snake_case.\r\n\r\n__You have a lot of opinions?__<br/>\r\nYes.\r\n",
